ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Frank (frankr6591) and I am interested in just about anything about python.   I'm retired and play a lot with different things.  Me and my wife are full time RV'ers traveling around the US. 

I focus on webscraping and data analysis related to interests of mine:  RV campground reservations, census and geopolitical analysis and various odds and ends.   I usually like small-medium projects. 

I am currently learning how to access various RV camp reservation data.   The logistics for reserving camp sites is a mess.  The demand is HUGE while the supply is is KAOS of distributed data sources: National Parks, State Parks, City Local parks, and Private parks, etc..  

I am trying once again to jump into `github` dev environments and see if I can share code.  I prefer to work locally since network is always great as we travel.   Still, when network is good, like to play in `github`. 

I like to troll stackoverflow, Facebook Python Beginners and other sources.  

ðŸ“« How to reach me, hummm.... find me on Facebook and `github`.
